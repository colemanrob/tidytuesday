tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2020-08-11')

avatar <- tuesdata$avatar



```


I know nothing of the Avatar series, but do like line graphs! :D

```{r}
avatar %>% 
  glimpse()

avatar_avg <- avatar %>% 
  group_by(book) %>% 
  summarize(avg_rating = mean(imdb_rating, na.rm = T))

line_plot <- avatar %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = chapter_num, y = imdb_rating, color = book)) +
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Chapters from the Fire book consistently score higher than Earth and Water with few exceptions",
       subtitle = "Avatar chapter by IMDB ratings",
       x = "Chapter Number",
       y = "IMDB Rating",
       color = "Book")


ggsave(here::here("viz/avatar_line.png"))



```
